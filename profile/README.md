# NAVADMIN Viewer

NAVADMIN Viewer lets you read and search within Navy and Marine Corps messages anywhere.

The app automatically retrieves the latest NAVADMIN, ALNAV, MARADMIN, and ALMARS for convenient viewing and searching on your phone and computer.

***NAVADMIN Viewer is an independent project developed in my free time.***

## ‚ùî FAQ

- **Is this an official government product?**

  No. NAVADMIN Viewer comes with no warranty or claim of accuracy. The user is responsible for verifying information with official sources.

- **Can you make *XXX* feature or fix a bug?**

  I currently work on this in my own time not paid for by the government. Sending bugs that you can reproduce are appreciated.

- **Why does the iOS app have more features than the Android app?**

  I personally use an iPhone so it is faster and more convenient to bring new features to the iOS app. *It will make sense when you look at my Linkedin.*

- **Are you charging money for public data?**

  No, the data is publicly available on the NavyHR and Marine Online websites. NAVADMIN Viewer app is free to use. The iOS app has an [optional in-app purchase](https://ansonliu.com/2022/09/navadmin-viewer-update-extended-access/) which supports my development of NAVADMIN Viewer. **While the data may be free, my time is not.** I am grateful to those who have contributed and made maintenance of NAVADMIN Viewer possible.

  If you know the right people at DoN/OPNAV to make this app official, please connect us because I would love to spend more time adding features to the app and make it accessible to sailors and civilians for free. Please.

- **How do I use the app data feed in my own work?**

  Please let me know. I can just send you the messages directly instead. Running the app costs me money. Don't ruin it for everyone.

- **I have more questions.**

## üîß Common Issues

### Enabling Notifications for New Messages on iOS

NAVADMIN Viewer on iOS requires enabling the app's **Notifications** and **Background App Refresh** access options in **Settings > Apps > NAVADMIN** in order to notify you of new messages. 

- Using NAVADMIN Viewer regularly allows the app to check for new messages in the background more frequently.
- Notifications are disabled while iOS Low Power Mode is on.
